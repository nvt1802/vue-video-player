[Thuy Minh’s voice]
"If you ask me about ambiguous (50/50) relationships

2
00:00:03.873 --> 00:00:06.303
I think they are relationships that two people have feelings for each other

3
00:00:06.303 --> 00:00:08.303
but they fear of taking a step forward,

4
00:00:08.303 --> 00:00:10.034
and such relationships make us contemplative,

5
00:00:10.034 --> 00:00:12.796
because of in their essence, we don't know how far we can go”
